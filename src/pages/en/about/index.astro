<PageLayout title='About' {headings} info='/en/about' locale='en' alternatePath='/about'>
  <p>Developer</p>
  <p>
    I am a second-year student at the University of Melbourne, focused on frontend development and
    growing into a full-stack engineer through real projects and open-source work.
  </p>
  <p>My motto: Build fast, learn faster.</p>

  <h2 id='about-me'>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy turning ideas into polished products. Most of my recent work sits at the intersection
    of frontend engineering, product thinking, and AI-assisted workflows.
  </p>

  <h2 id='interests'>Interests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Music</strong> - Piano and cello are still my favorite way to reset after coding.</li>
    <li><strong>Photography</strong> - I recently started exploring photography and visual storytelling.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Source</strong> - I actively contribute and learn through public projects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id='journey'>Coding Journey</h2>
  <Collapse title='How I started'>
    I started with HTML/CSS in my first year and gradually moved into React-based product work.
    Building and deploying real projects taught me far more than tutorials.
  </Collapse>
  <Collapse title='What I focus on now'>
    I currently focus on full-stack project delivery, frontend architecture, and writing technical
    notes that are useful to other learners.
  </Collapse>

  <h2 id='blog'>About This Blog</h2>
  <p>
    This blog is my long-term knowledge base. I use it to document technical deep dives,
    implementation notes, and lessons from internships and side projects.
