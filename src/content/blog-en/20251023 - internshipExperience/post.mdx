## Background
As a second-year student in Melbourne, I applied for frontend internship roles in Shanghai during the Nov-Mar holiday window. Over about one week of dense interviews, I received around 10 offers.

## Application Snapshot
- Positions contacted: 210
- Resume exchanges: 51
- Interview conversion: ~15%
- Offers: ~10
- Main channel: BOSS Zhipin

## High-Frequency Interview Topics
### React
- Hooks and effect dependencies
- State management patterns
- Render optimization (`memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`)

### JavaScript
- ES6+ fundamentals
- Async control flow and error handling
- Common hand-written problems (debounce/throttle/dedupe)

### TypeScript
- core types, `interface` vs `type`
- basic generics and utility types

### CSS / Layout
- responsive strategies
- Flex and Grid tradeoffs
- practical component-level layout decisions

## Preparation Strategy
1. Spend 80% effort on React + JS + CSS fundamentals.
2. Spend 20% on TS, networking basics, and build tools.
3. Build small demos and explain tradeoffs clearly in interviews.

## Resume Advice
- Only list technologies you can explain under pressure.
- Focus on impact and measurable outcomes.
- Keep project bullets concrete and implementation-oriented.

## Final Takeaway
SMB frontend interviews care most about usable engineering basics. If your fundamentals are solid and your communication is structured, conversion can be surprisingly high.
