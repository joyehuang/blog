This post is part 1 of my MiniMind learning series.

## Core Question
Why do Transformer blocks apply normalization so frequently, and why does modern LLM training prefer RMSNorm over LayerNorm?

## Key Points
- Deep stacks without normalization suffer from unstable activations and vanishing gradients.
- RMSNorm stabilizes scale while preserving direction, which is often enough for robust optimization.
- Compared with LayerNorm, RMSNorm is computationally lighter and widely used in modern LLM architectures.

## Practical Perspective
In implementation terms, RMSNorm is simple and reliable:
- normalize by root-mean-square
- keep a learnable scale parameter
- avoid unnecessary centering overhead when not needed

## Why It Matters in Transformer Blocks
Pre-norm design (`Norm -> SubLayer -> Residual`) improves training stability at depth, and RMSNorm works well with this pattern.

## Summary
RMSNorm is not just a micro-optimization. It is a key ingredient that keeps deep Transformer training stable while reducing compute overhead.
