This post is part 2 of my MiniMind learning series.

## Problem Statement
Vanilla attention is permutation-invariant. Without positional signals, token order is not represented correctly.

## Why RoPE
RoPE injects position through rotation in paired dimensions, allowing attention to carry relative positional structure naturally.

## Key Intuition
- Each token vector is rotated by a position-dependent angle.
- Different frequency bands encode different positional granularities.
- Relative distance emerges directly in attention score interactions.

## Engineering Notes
- Floating-point precision and frequency scaling matter for long-context behavior.
- Correct dimension pairing and rotation implementation is essential.

## Summary
RoPE is elegant because it introduces position with minimal architectural complexity while preserving strong performance and compatibility with standard attention blocks.
