## Intro
On June 27, 2025 (Melbourne time), I submitted my first pull request to the VMind project in the VisActor community. I was excited and nervous at the same time. For a long time, open source felt like something only "very advanced" developers could do.

## How I Found the Project
I discovered VMind while scanning JavaScript-related OSPP topics. I contacted a mentor and then joined the VisActor contributors group. The collaboration flow was friendly and clear: pick an issue, comment, sync in the group, and receive feedback quickly.

## What I Worked On
I picked a unit-test issue and implemented tests for `getChartSpecWithContext_boxplot`. The goal was to verify data field mapping and chart-spec generation logic for BoxPlot charts.

## What Helped Me Most
- Reading existing tests before writing my own.
- Using AI for guidance, not for copy-paste answers.
- Asking reviewers early and iterating quickly after feedback.

## The Merge Moment
After two rounds of updates, the PR was merged on July 1, 2025. That moment gave me confidence to keep contributing.

## Key Takeaways
- First PRs are mostly about process, not brilliance.
- Imitating strong examples is a valid learning strategy.
- Owning an issue creates healthy pressure and momentum.

If you are considering open source, start with one small issue and keep going.
